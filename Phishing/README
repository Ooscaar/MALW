Good morning Peter,

The company Energy Plus S.A. has contacted us because they have a problem establishing connections with some new equipment that they have set up recently.

I need you to run the program attached to this e-mail to test if there is any problem with the connectivity. The program tests the connectivity of the machines executing a ping to the corresponding IP addresses through an ansible program, which as you already may know, is useful to automate processes. Next, I will explain to you how to execute it step-by-step:

1.- Copy the link I have attached to this e-mail which contains the program file.

2.- Create a new project called Energy Plus Connectivity Test with the link that you have copied. Take into aaccount that the link contains a TAR file.
3.- Create an inventory with all the IP addresses that we need to check. You can find a list of these IP addresses in the shared company files (in the Energy Plus section)
4.- Execute the ping.yml playbook with the inventory that you have just created.

Please, write a report informing the availability of every machine and their respective delays. I will need the results as soon as possible, Energy Plus is one of the most important clients for our company.

Thank you in advance, and sorry for the urge.

David Garden
